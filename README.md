SimSyCam - Simple Symbian Camera
================================

SimSyCam is a small Python script for Symbian S60 smartphones. It takes static pictures **without** any **shutter sound** and saves them to a memory card.

Controls
--------
`SelectKey` - take a photo  
`4` - exposure mode  
`5` - flash mode  
`6` - white balance

Requirements
------------
In order to use SimSyCam, you must have [PyS60](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60/files/pys60/) and Python Script Shell installed on your Symbian S60 phone.

About
-----
I wrote SimSyCam a few years ago because the default Camera application in Nokia 6120 classic hasn't had an option to turn off the shutter sound. I no longer own any Symbian device, so the development will probably not continue.
